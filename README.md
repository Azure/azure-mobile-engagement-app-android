## Getting Started

### Download Source Code

To get the source code of our SDK and sample via git just type:

```
    git clone https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-engagement-app-android.git
    cd ./azure-mobile-engagement-app-android/
```

### Configuration

Test locally the emulation of the SDK or create your own AzME campaigns to test push notification, Web Announcement, Poll or Data Push. Keep in mind that you have to set up same categories as specified in `AndroidManifest.xml` and `AzmeNotifier.java`


```
    <activity android:name=".ReboundFullScreenInterstitialActivity"
    >
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="com.microsoft.azure.engagement.reach.intent.action.ANNOUNCEMENT"/>
        <category android:name="INTERSTITIAL"/>
        <category android:name="WEB_ANNOUNCEMENT"/>
        <data android:mimeType="text/html"/>
      </intent-filter>
    </activity>
```

```
    private static final String IN_APP_POP_UP_CATEGORY = "POP-UP";
    private static final String INTERSTITIAL_CATEGORY = "INTERSTITIAL";
```

### Run the app : use your own AzME Endpoint

To test the SDK and AzME Platform, configure your Endpoint in `AzmeApplication.java`

```
    final EngagementConfiguration engagementConfiguration = new EngagementConfiguration();
    engagementConfiguration.setConnectionString("Endpoint=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX");
    EngagementAgent.getInstance(this).init(engagementConfiguration);
```

You have to configure an Endpoint otherwise you cannot test the app correctly with the SDK. You also have to configure your own GCM project ID in the `AndroidManifest.xml`.

```
    <meta-data
      android:name="engagement:gcm:sender"
      android:value="XXXXXXXXXXXX\n"
    />
```
